# password_generator

## Description
This project was to create a password generator using Javascript that when a button was pressed, pop-up screens come up that ask for how long you wanted the password and then what characters (upper/lowercase letters, numbers, special characters) you wanted to add into your password. Then it would generate a password on the screen for you.
